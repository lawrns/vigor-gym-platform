## Data Model Enhancements

### Core Entity Relationships

The upgraded data model introduces sophisticated relationships that support complex business operations while maintaining data integrity and performance. The new schema includes 15 primary entities with over 40 relationship mappings that enable comprehensive business intelligence and automated workflows.

**Gym and Location Hierarchy**
The platform now supports multi-location gym operations with hierarchical data organization. Each gym can have multiple locations, with members able to access services across locations based on their subscription plans. This structure supports franchise operations and gym chains while maintaining individual location analytics and management.

**Subscription and Billing Integration**
The subscription model is completely redesigned to support complex billing scenarios including trials, upgrades, downgrades, and promotional pricing. The system tracks subscription lifecycle events and automatically generates invoices with full CFDI 4.0 compliance. Payment methods are securely stored with tokenization and support multiple Mexican payment providers.

**Member Lifecycle Tracking**
Enhanced member profiles include comprehensive lifecycle tracking from initial contact through referral generation. The system maintains detailed interaction history, preference tracking, and behavioral analytics that feed into AI-powered retention and engagement systems.

### Advanced Data Structures

);

-- Referral performance analytics
CREATE INDEX idx_referrals_performance ON referrals(gym_id, status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_referrals_expiry ON referrals(expires_at) WHERE status = 'issued';
```

**AI-Powered Member Intelligence**
```sql
-- Enhanced member profiles with AI insights
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN churn_score DECIMAL(3,2);
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN churn_risk churn_risk_level;
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN last_visit_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN engagement_score DECIMAL(3,2);
