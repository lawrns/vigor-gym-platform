## Project Overview and Development Philosophy

The Vigor platform represents a comprehensive AI-powered gym management solution specifically designed for the Mexican market. This development guide provides a structured approach to building the platform from initial setup through production deployment, with clear task definitions, branching strategies, and quality assurance processes.

The development approach follows modern software engineering best practices including microservices architecture, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), test-driven development (TDD), and agile methodologies. The project is structured to support rapid iteration while maintaining high code quality and system reliability.

All development tasks are organized into logical phases that can be executed by distributed teams while maintaining consistency and integration. The branching strategy ensures code quality through peer review and automated testing, while the deployment pipeline enables rapid feature delivery and rollback capabilities.

## Development Workflow and Branching Strategy

### Git Branching Model

The project follows a modified GitFlow branching strategy optimized for continuous deployment and feature development:

**Main Branches:**
- `main`: Production-ready code, protected branch
- `develop`: Integration branch for features, auto-deploys to staging
- `staging`: Pre-production testing branch

**Supporting Branches:**
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Branch Management Rules

**Main Branch Protection:**
- Requires pull request reviews (minimum 2 approvals)
- Requires status checks to pass (CI/CD pipeline)
- Requires branches to be up to date before merging
- Restricts pushes to main branch (no direct commits)
- Requires administrator review for sensitive changes

**Feature Branch Workflow:**
1. Create feature branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b feature/member-management`
2. Develop feature with regular commits
3. Push feature branch and create pull request to `develop`
4. Code review and automated testing
5. Merge to `develop` after approval
6. Delete feature branch after merge

**Release Workflow:**
1. Create release branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b release/v1.0.0`
2. Final testing and bug fixes on release branch
3. Merge release branch to `main` and `develop`
4. Tag release on main branch
5. Deploy to production from main branch

### Commit Message Standards

Follow Conventional Commits specification for consistent commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication service
fix(billing): resolve CFDI invoice generation error
docs(api): update member management API documentation
```
